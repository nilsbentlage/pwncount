# This is PWNCount
## A small PWA to count whatever you like

Consisting of **create-react-app, firebase auth, database & hosting**, PWNCount manages to serve multiple Instances of a smallest-as-possible front- and backend for a simple counter. One for every signedin user.

You can create your own counter in my instance [pwncount.web.app](pwncount.web.app) or host your own instance via google firebase. Just pull this project, connect it to firebase, ativate database & auth and you're ready to go. 

#### You just need to add the firebase .env-configuration-file

## WTF ist this sh**?

I came up with the Idea when a friend of mine wanted to track his ingame deaths for the audience of his Twitch-Stream. Now he is able to set up his phone, standing by the monitor, and to add one count manually if he gets shot. On the other Hand there's a "display"-View he can integrate in his OBS-Strream. 

When he wished to change the displayed text, so he could also count his own kills or stuff like that, i implemented that for him, too.

Feel free to enhance whatever you like. I think my code is far away from the best you've ever read so i'm really excited about your ideas and criticism.
